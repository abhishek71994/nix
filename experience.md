## Nix experience so far

29th Jan 2025

I tried nix flake. No idea what is it. But seems to not be working.

Then I read this [blog](https://yatyin.medium.com/learning-nix-part-1-19da6d0f45a1)

And it has a much simpler way to use `nix-shell`

Which makes sense for now. But I definitely wanna go back and see more on
what flake does.
